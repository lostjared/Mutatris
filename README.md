Welcome to **Mutatris**, a fast-paced puzzle game where you control blocks on a grid and aim to clear rows and columns by aligning blocks of the same color. The more you clear, the higher your score—can you keep up as the game speeds up?

## How to Play

- **Controls:**
  - **Move Left**: Shift the active block left.
  - **Move Right**: Shift the active block right.
  - **Move Down**: Move the active block down.
  - **Drop Block**: Instantly drop the active block to the bottom of the grid. Press the 'S" key
  - **Rotate Block**: Rotate the active block to change its orientation. Press the 'A' or Space key

- **Objective:**
  Align 3 or more blocks of the same color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. When a match is made, the blocks will disappear, and your score will increase. If 4 blocks match, you will earn a combo bonus.

- **Game Mechanics:**
  - The game features multiple grids, each with its own active block.
  - As the game progresses, the blocks drop faster, and you'll need to plan your moves quickly.
  - Keep an eye on your **clears** count—every 4 clears will speed up the game.

- **Scoring:**
  - Aligning 3 blocks: +1 point.
  - Aligning 4 blocks (combo): +10 points.

- **Game Over:**
  The game ends when a block reaches the top of any grid, preventing you from placing new blocks.

## Game Features

- **Multiple Grids**: Manage multiple grids simultaneously, switching between them to optimize your block placements.
- **Speeding Up**: Every 4 clears, the game speeds up, making it more challenging.
- **Score Tracking**: Try to get the highest score by clearing rows and triggering combos.
- **Randomized Blocks**: The blocks come in different colors and are randomized to keep each game fresh.
